# String Calculator

This is a simple Ruby-based string calculator that implements the following functionalities:

- **Adding numbers**: It accepts comma-separated or newline-separated numbers and returns their sum.
- **Custom delimiters**: It supports custom delimiters defined by the user.
- **Negative number handling**: It raises an error if negative numbers are present in the input.
- **Ignore numbers greater than 10000**: Any numbers greater than 10000 are ignored in the sum calculation.
- **Error handling for invalid input**: Non-numeric input will raise an error indicating which invalid number caused the issue.
